We must hasten this process with cold ruthlessness.” ― Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Minister of Propaganda, on February 14, 1942"

    "answers": ["Zionist", "Nazi"],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "“A Jew brought up among Germans may assume German custom, German words. He may be wholly imbued with that German fluid but the nucleus of his spiritual structure will always remain Jewish, because his blood, his body, his physical-racial type are Jewish. … It is impossible for a man to become assimilated with people whose blood is different from his own. In order to become assimilated, he must change his body, he must become one of them, in blood. … There can be no assimilation as long as there is no mixed marriage. … An increase in the number of mixed marriages is the only sure and infallible means for the destruction of nationality as such. … A preservation of national integrity is impossible except by a preservation of racial purity, and for that purpose we are in need of a territory of our own where our people will constitute the overwhelming majority.” ― Ze'ev Jabotinsky (né Vladimir Yevgenyevich Zhabotinsky), Revisionist Zionist leader who co-founded the Jewish Legion of the British Army in World War I, on June 06, 1904"

There is only one effective measure: cut them out. … If the Jews appeal to your sentimentality, realize that they are hoping for your forgetfulness and let them know that you see through them and hold them in contempt.” ― Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Minister of Propaganda, on November 16, 1941"

    "explanation": "“‘National Judaism’ will make the ancient soil fertile. It seems miraculous. Everything natural is miraculous. Once the nation which we Zionists are arousing is fully awakened, things will happen swiftly and dynamically.

Of course, the others are swine, but this one, he is a first-rate Jew.

And when I talk about destruction, I mean destruction like it was in Dresden and Hiroshima, without nuclear weapon.

On the contrary, they looked for the weakest cities and over there they dropped their rockets, to make it clear that they were serious.
